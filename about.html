    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      PMCBYGG is a construction company rooted in northern Sweden – where craftsmanship, reliability, and strong local connections go hand in hand.
We offer complete solutions for kitchen renovations, patios, new builds, roofing, garages, and bathrooms – always with the customer in focus.

With over 15 years of experience building in harsh climates and varying conditions, we know what it takes to deliver durable, high-quality results.
We work with pride and precision in every project – from the first meeting to the completed construction.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are two young co-owners from northern Sweden who found our way into the construction industry early on.
With several years of experience and strong roots in the local community, we know what it takes to get the job done – properly.
We work closely with our clients, with pride, precision, and an eye for detail – from the first nail to the finished project.
